## Relying on an expert guess

This summer, just two days before departure we cancelled our holiday trip to Italy, because the doctor advised my then few-weeks pregnant wife to avoid flying. The reason was a blurry little something they saw on the ultrasound (I mean, besides our future child, who was also a blurry little something at that point) which, according to the same doctor, was quite common and would most probably disappear without any noticable effect. 

‘No need to worry, but you should skip the trip’ - said the doctor. We readily complied, and never regretted it for a second. We had been planning all along with this possibility in mind and only booked things we could freely cancel anytime (a benefit of marrying someone in the airline industry). And then we went for a wonderful week in the countryside.

But so many common fallacies were packed into this single case that it bugged my analytical mind. Is it really how it should work? 

_(__Note:__ Even though I immediately wrote this piece, I did superstitiously wait for the 12th week to publish it. So much for being very rational.)_

## You want to avoid loss at any costs

Obviously we felt that a short (and not quite exotic) holiday in the Mediterranian wasn’t worth the risk of any issues with the pregnancy. Sounds reasonable, doesn’t it? But what if we could have known the _exact_ risk? Like there were some issues in exactly 1 in a million similar cases? Or 1 in a billion? Could this change our minds?

On the other hand many studies proved that human brain is wired for loss-aversion. It forces us to chose scenarios where the perceived loss is lower, even when the expected value (the sum of outcomes, each weighted by its probability) is worse than in other alternatives. We want to avoid losing our future child so we act accordingly even if it has equal chance to being hit by an asteroid with a rainbow-colored unicorn named Jeff riding on it.

Perhaps the probabilities were many order of magnitude higher, but as I cannot tell you the ‘value’ of (not) having issues when expecting a baby, I cannot tell you what percentage we would have considered ‘acceptable’ risk either (and you rarely get those numbers anyway, more on that later).

## You cannot handle probabilities

The human mind is not prepared to work with probabilistic outcomes and think of expected values. Our ancestors did not want to assess the chances of being slaughtered by a sabertooth tiger on a statistical basis, let alone repeat the same experiment thousand times to have a fair understanding of the probability distribution. Most of them just ran away, and the remaining prehistoric statisticians fell victim to natural selection.

It works the other way around, too. We buy lottery tickets or invest in lottery-like securities for the promise of extreme payout with extreme low probability. Think of a biotech penny stock on the verge of bankruptcy that might succefully finish the clinical tests of its only - but hopefully life-changing - product at some unspecified time in the future. There are people investing in things like that.

So we are in general very bad at assessing tail-risks and expected values, especially when it includes lot of factors. Of course our specific case was not a typical everyday dilemma, but people react similarly to smaller common problems. And huge businesses are built upon these fallacies (stock market is a great example of that).

## The inner workings of an expert advice

We also faced a special agent-problem with our ‘expert’, the doctor. It was not his fault, we all have the same issue with almost all the experts we tend to rely upon. 

I suspect our renowned professor did not tell us any estimation about the risk we were facing because he also didn’t know. But it is not an option for him to admit it. Should something bad happen during a trip he approved he would not be able to explain that the issue was not related to it (he wouldn’t even know himself).

So he followed his loss-averse instincts and made the rational decision of tossing the risk around, playing it out on _our_ loss-aversion. This way it was our call to make the trip _against_ his advise, but how would _I_ know if all this precaution was unnecessary?

## They don’t know what will happen

We like this doctor as he is a nice guy and very good at lots of things, but his professional experience and academic knowledge does not make him a prophet. Things that might happen in the body of a pregnant woman under special circumstances is too complex to predict in details (except when the symptoms are quite obvious) with the rudimentary _expert opinions_ that we still mostly rely on in healthcare. 

But that’s far less unreliable than the predictions of stock market pundits (at least the doctor stayed on the safe side). I was part of that circus, and rarely heard saying

> _’Take your time, and let us know if you happened to figure out something with reasonable probabilities attached to it. It doesn’t matter if you can come up with something only once a year, just try to be as thorough as possible.’_ 

You have to say something specific and certain about the future _all the time_. That’s why stock market people resort to using clichés and professional language that might sound very knowledgable but in fact is pure gibberish (experts using special language in public is generally a very good sign of bullshit).

It is also like buying lottery tickets: maybe you get lucky and nail something important in advance, that will make you _The Expert_. The pay-off can be huge while being wrong is quite okay if you wrapped your message in proper amount of bullshit. So many market experts try to make as many long shots as possible, hoping that they hit the target once.

## We need much more data

So experts are not exempt from all the psychological pitfalls every human have to deal with, but even burdened by some others. Still, it does not necessarily mean we should completely avoid them. On the contrary.

Besides many important things the doctors have always provided great service by _explaining the current condition_ of a patient, a good stock market analyst could give you comprehensive summary of the _current state of a company_ or industry, and so on. 

You just shouldn’t expect them to make predictions or deeply analyse all the available options in their entirety. The ultimate solution for that is using enough data in place of circumstantial and anecdotal evidence.

Maybe if the advice for us came in a form of 

> _’in XX thousand cases flying caused minor issues in 0.00X% and major issues in 0.000X% of the cases for pregnant women with similar condition, and when a certain action made, these rates fell by XX%’_, 

we would have made the same decision, but it would have been much more educated and sound. (Okay, I guess not all patients are as obsessed with data as I am).

Or better, imagine that the advice was based on a model that _continuously_ evaluates hundreds of different external and internal factors about the body of the mother (obtained through wearable or even implanted devices) and compares it to a vast database of pregnant women under different circumstances all around the world. It’s not even sci-fi, it’s all existing technology.

## AI needs humans

This means much less ‘expert’ guesses in the future, and maybe a little less irrationality in everyday decision-making. But for a long-long time we will still need human experts to build, finetune, operate and explain the results of such artificial intelligence. 

The looming AI revolution threatens the most the experts in every field, but also they can benefit the most from transferring their expertise to artificial intelligence. And while industrial automation and replacement of human workforce has been a trend for decades, for the well-educated experts this is still something new.

But worry not, the world has a use for you.
