title: My thing with coding
subtitle: 
---

First of all let’s settle on one thing: I will use the word _’coding’_ for what I do, not _’programming’_ and especially not _’software development’_. I think it’s much simpler this way and hopefully not offend my _real_ software developer friends (mind you, I’m not that cautious with my imaginary developer friends). Also ‘coding’ fits better to activities like data wrangling or data analysis in general, as most of the time the code produced there is not a stand-alone software, not even a self-contained piece of software, does not use elaborate algorithms, does not follow the procedures of software development, but still it is (should be) code that works.
