<p><b>I'm Andr√°s Somi, a natural-born analyst, investor, data and technology enthusiast and <em>rational daydreamer</em> based in Budapest, Hungary. This blog is the journal of my adventures in code, data science and investments.</b></p>

<p>In the past 10 years I worked as a journalist, equity analyst, team leader of analysts and marketers, and finally a manager of digital business development of a stock brokerage company. I left my job in June, 2017, to pursue my own dreams instead of working for someone else's goals. You can read about my story, motivations and future plans <a href="http://dotkomblog.com/2017/07/18/changes/">in this post</a>.</p>

<p>The predecessor of this blog was born in 2010, a year before I joined KBC Securities, with the goal of taking a deep dive into technology and financial markets. That was fun, but after working 6 years at stock markets, I'm less enthusiastic about commenting the everyday ups and downs, and much more excited about the journey I started with coding and data science.</p>

<p>I'm available for freelance advisory and projects. If you want to get in touch with me just click on any of the options at the bottom of the page.</p>
