<p><b>I'm Andr√°s Somi, a natural-born analyst, data and technology enthusiast living in Budapest, Hungary. This blog - when updated - is the journal of my adventures in data, technology and investments. (When the blog is not updated, either no adventure happens or too much happens too fast.)</b></p>

<p>In the past 15 years I worked as a journalist, equity research analyst, lead teams and had been responsible for digital biz dev at a stock brokerage firm. I left my job in June, 2017, to do things on my own terms. You can read about my story, motivations and future plans <a href="http://dotkomblog.com/2017/07/18/changes/">in this post</a>.</p>

<p>Since then I have done some freelance consulting in data and analytics and later became a data scientist at a New York based boutique investment firm.</p>
