I had [a pledge in July](https://dotkomblog.com/life/2017/07/18/changes/) to read as much as I can besides my studies and other activities. More precisely, I aimed for one book per week, _’serious’_ and entertaining ones inlcuded. It’s been almost 4 months now, so I assessed where I stand with this plan.

It turns out I scored around 70% on my goal, as I fully read 12 books in about 17 weeks. That translates to roughly one book in 10 days on average, not counting the ones I haven’t finished yet or completely abandoned. It’s not that far from my initial target, so I’ll just try to keep the pace.

It’s much more important that I found some true gems that I would happily recommend to anyone. I was lucky to pick great books in investments and data, and much less lucky with sci-fi and fantasy books for leisure time. The outlier is __Never Split the Difference__, which ended up as one of my favourites this summer. It’s a practical eye-opener on key elements of negotiations in our everyday life.

## The full list

So here’s my full list from the past 4 months. I won’t review the books, but feel free to ask about any of them, or let me know, what do you think about the ones you already read.

_(The scoring is completely subjective on a scale from 1 to 10. It reflects how satisfied I was with the book in general, taking into account the relevance, the novelty of the ideas, readability, plot, style, etc. 8 or above means I enjoyed and recommend it, less than 5 means it is not worth the time. With the trilogies I followed this logic: if I ended up reading the sequel, the book scores at least 5, even if I lost interest or was utterly disappointed later.)_
