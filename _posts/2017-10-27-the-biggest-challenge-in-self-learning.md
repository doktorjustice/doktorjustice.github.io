I was a bit surprised (in a positive way) to get this result in this [Pluralsight assessment](https://www.pluralsight.com/product/pluralsight-iq):

This is not an unquestionable source of truth, just a nice quiz, even though Pluralsight claims to have a sophisticated methodology to build the questionaire on the fly, based on your previous answers (which it _seems_ to be doing). I don’t see a reason why they would want to systematically overestimate my skills, nevertheless it’s still just an uncertain result from mere 18 questions.

## It’s been only a year

I checked my learning log (I have a rather detailed account of my courses from the past few years) and it turned out that I first ventured into _Python Land_ just a little more than a year ago, during summer of 2016. Feels lot more.

It all started with a two-day long [Data Science Bootcamp by Streambright](https://www.facebook.com/events/2044086375817540/) (which I sort of enjoyed then, but I value the experience a lot more now) for which I quickly skimmed some introductory courses to at least have some idea about the basic syntax. Then a lot more followed, packed into a very busy year.

It was a sort of relief realising that I have only been playing around with Python for a year or so, as I tend to beat up myself for not knowing something or being slow when trying to accomplish things in Python (or in anything else, actually). I stopped for a while to appreciate the journey taken so far.

## “How good do you think you are?”

After a few years of self-learning I feel that I know lot more than a complete newbie, but I have no way to confidently label myself as _junior_, _experienced_ or whatever labels people use. Not that I am that eager to categorize myself, but in some cases it’s somewhat necessary for efficient communication.

So this question I got recently is a difficult one for me:

> ‘How proficient do you think you are in coding?’

My honest answer is that I can only guess but I don’t know.
